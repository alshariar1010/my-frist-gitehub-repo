        <h3>🤖 What Is a Robot</h3>
        <p class="dpt">A robot is a machine—often programmable by a computer—that can carry out a series of actions
            automatically. But they’re more than just nuts, bolts, and blinking lights! Here's how they break down

            🧠 The Basics
        </h3>
        <p>
            - Mechanically Built: They have physical bodies made of metal, plastic, or other materials.
            - Programmable Brain: They're controlled by software or artificial intelligence that tells them what to do.
            - Sensors & Actuators: Many robots use sensors (like cameras or touch sensors) to perceive their
            surroundings and actuators (like motors) to move or perform tasks.

        <h3>⚙️ Types of Robots
        </h3>
        <p>
            - Industrial Robots: Work in factories—like robotic arms assembling cars.
            - Service Robots: Help with chores, deliveries, or even hotel check-ins.
            - Exploration Robots: Go where humans can’t—like Mars rovers or deep-sea probes.
            - Social or Companion Robots: Designed to interact with people, sometimes even mimicking emotions.
